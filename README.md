# doooDashboard
R/Shiny scripts to generate a dashboard of aggregate domain registration statistics for UMW's Domain of One's Own initiative

These scripts assume the presence of the following files in the dataSources folder (which have been omitted for user privacy):

- banner_data.csv (user data from institutional information system database)  
- enomReport.csv (domain names with registration, renewal, and expiration dates from DoOO domain registrar)  
- wordpress_users.csv (basic user data from umw.domains, the site where users signup for DoOO)  
- wordpress_users_meta.csv (additional metadata to help flag faculty/staff no longer in the SIS database)
